## Installation

I have built this whole project using Python version 3.8.10. So, My advice is to install Python if you did not, and if you are using a lower version, upgrade it using the pip package. Lastly, After cloning the repositories, install the required packages and libraries from the following command.

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
